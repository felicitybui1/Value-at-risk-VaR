# Monte Carlo Stock Portfolio Simulation

**by Felicity Bui**

## Overview

The Monte Carlo Method is a powerful statistical technique used to model the probability of different outcomes in processes that involve random variables. This project leverages the Monte Carlo simulation to model and analyze the stock performance of five major tech companies:

- Apple Inc.
- Microsoft Corporation
- Amazon.com Inc.
- Alphabet Inc.
- Meta Platforms, Inc.

### Applications
- **Risk Management:** Evaluate potential losses and risks in a portfolio.
- **Option Pricing:** Estimate the value of options and other derivatives.
- **Simulating Financial Scenarios:** Predict future stock performance and market behavior.


Monte Carlo simulation provides a robust framework for analyzing the risk and potential return of a stock portfolio. <br>
By simulating various market scenarios, investors can better understand potential outcomes and make more informed decisions. <br><br>

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs and extend the analysis further. <br>
Happy coding!
